    "text": "Words of Encouragement\nFor the next 10 weeks, your learning journey will be very bumpy, especially come to R programming\n\nLearning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2 — made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, and don’t hesitate to approach me.\nThe students who have a bad time in this course are the ones who don’t work with one another to learn. We are a learning community, and we should help each other to learn.\nIf you understand something and someone is struggling with it, try and help them. If you are struggling, take a breath, and try to pinpoint what you are struggling with.\nOur goal is to be better programmers each day, not to be the perfect programmer. There’s no such thing as a perfect programmer. I’ve been learning new things almost every day.\nI promise you can succeed in this class as long as you are willing to learn, practice, be open minded and don’t give up easily."

    "text": "Course Components\nThe assessment for this course consists of four major components, namely:\n\nPre-lesson Preparation and Hands-on Exercise\nIn-class Exercise and Class Participation\nTake-home exercises\nVisual Analytics Project\n\n\nPre-lesson Preparation and Hands-on Exercise\nPre-lesson videos/slides and recommended readings exercises will be released one week before the weekly lesson starts. A strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned readings and video before coming to class. Students are encouraged to post question or issue encountered while viewing the video or reading the recommended articles on Piazza. Student sharing of insights from readings of assigned materials on Piazza will form a large part of the learning in this course. After learning the data visuaisation concepts and methods from lesson materials, the hands-on exercises aim to provide students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience on using selected R packages. It is important for students to complete the hands-on exercises before class. This is because the in-class discussion will extend the methods learned from the hands-on exercise to advanced modelling.\n\n\nIn-class Exercise and Class Participation\nDuring lesson, students are required to complete a series of in-class exercises using either Tableau or R. The in-class discussion will focus on how to critic existing data visualisation and how to deliver effective visual communication. In general, these exercises are guided interactively. By the end of each lesson, students are required to publish their in-class exercise on Tableau Public or Netlify.\n\n\nTake-home Exercise\nThe take-home exercise provides students with the opportunity to revise and practice the R packages and programming skills they had learned in class at home. It is a weekly exercise. Each exercise is designed to be completed within 3-5 hours. The exercise is not a repetition of the in-class exercise but it requires students to be innovative and creative in applying appropriate R packages to design enlightening and yet functional data visualisation for analytics purposes.\nStudents may work together to help one another with R programming issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s\n\n\nVisual Analytics Project\nThe purpose of the project is to provide students first hand experience on building web-enabled visual analytics application by using Shiny. It aims to democratize data and analytics. Hence, the application focuses and emphasises on interactivity and effective integration of techniques from data analytics and data visualization.\nFor more details please refer to Visual Analytics Project page."

    "text": "Motivation of Visual Analytics\nThe World is full of charts that lie!\n\nWe need to get smarter about visual information\n\nIt is very common you see infographic of this kind appears on our daily newspaper. At a first glance, it seems making a lot of sense. But, when we try to take a closer look at the text and graph, you will notice that there are at least two major issues, one is related to truthfulness of the data visualisation and the second one is related to its clarity aspect. For example, the x-axis is showing quarterly time interval. But, the second sentence talks about “For the first half this year, Nodx fell 4.5 per cent compared with the same period last year.” which is not inline with what was shown on the x-axis. Furthermore, the values on the y-axis are in per cent. Hence the correct term should be percentage point instead of per cent because we are comparing the differences between two percentages.\nThis is what motivate me to design this course. This course is not about using Tableau or R to create beautiful data visualisation only. More importantly, it aims to embark you the skills of getting smarter when reading data visualisation. From today onwards, I would like to encourage you to take a good look at every data visualisation you come across and carefully evaluate them not only from their aestheticness only but also their clarity."

I call this Junk Chart. As we know, junk foods are very tempting but not healthy. Similar, Junk Charts tends to be very appealing but they are not useful to gain data understanding. For example, it is not possible for us to do an effective comparison between global sales revenue and reinvestment in R&D because of the inappropriate use of 3d bar chart.\nThe important take away from this slide is to avoid creating eye candy data visualisation. We should create data visualisation that are functional instead."

It shows the results of five models output. Unfortunately, it is not easy to compare the differences between them. This is partly because the value range of their y-axis are not the same. Further more by stitching the line graph top down and next jump to the right fail for support effective comparison.\nThe data visualisation on the right is a makeover version. It was created using the trellis method of JMP Pro. In this case, all line graphs maintain the same value range. As a result, the data visualisation reveals the differences between the five models clearly.\nAlso, by arranging the model results from left to right according to their calibration, allows us to compare the performance of each model effectively."

As shown in the figure. In a knowledge discovery process, visual analytics provide data analysts useful understanding of the data. These understanding can be used to support effective model building.\nData visualisation also should be used to reveal modelling results. Furthermore, by using data visualisation to communicate complex modelling results to senior management, in general, are more effectively than showing them complex equations."

The line graph on the slide is a good example. This is a trade balance line graph prepared by William Playfair in 1786. You probably have identify this chart as a common line graph. The horizontal axis is years, the vertical axis measures the volume of imports and export. When you take a good look at the graph, you will be very impressed by conscious effort given by the author to shade the space between the import and export lines. When the trade balance was against England, the area was shared in red and when the trade balance was in favour of England, the area was shaded in brown. With the advancement of graph drawing tools, sadly to say, we hardly see this carefully crafted line graph been used."

If you take a closer look at the map, you will notice that it is not a normal dot map we commonly prepared using Google Map or other data visualisation toolkits like Tableau or PowerBI. In the map, cholera cases are highlighted in black, showing the clusters of cholera cases (indicated by stacked rectangles) in the London epidemic of 1854.

Many of us know Florence as The Mother of Nursing, but she was also a statistician, and reformer. If we look at the rose diagram, we can see that the area of each coloured wedge, measured from the centre, is in proportion to the statistic it represents. The blue outer wedges represent the deaths from contagious diseases, such as cholera and typhus. The central red wedges show the deaths from wounds. The black wedges in between represent deaths from all other causes. If this rate had continued, and troops had not been replaced frequently, then disease alone would have killed the entire British Army in the Crimea. Nightingale’s graph not only dramatised the extent of the needless deaths among the soldiers during the Crimean War, but it was used as a tool to persuade Victorial government and medical profession that deaths were preventable if sanitation reforms were implemented in military and civilian hospitals."

At the first glance, it resemble the flow map but the map actually reveal more information than a common flow map. The illustration depicts Napoleon’s army departing the Polish-Russian border. A thick band illustrates the size of his army at specific geographic points during their advance and retreat. It displays six types of data in two dimensions: the number of Napoleon’s troops; the distance traveled; temperature; latitude and longitude; direction of travel; and location relative to specific dates without making mention of Napoleon; Minard’s interest lay with the travails and sacrifices of the soldiers. This type of band graph for illustration of flows was later called a Sankey diagram, although Matthew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey (9 November 1853 – 3 October 1926) used this visualisation 30 years later and only for thematic energy flow. Interestingly, If you take a closer look at the lower center of the graph, you will notice that the term Tableau Graphique was used.\nThe important learning lesson from these four historical data visualisation is that in order to design a functional and yet enlightening data visualisation, we need to master the science and arts of data visualisation design instead of using default graphing functions of modern data visualisation toolkit. Just like writing, by knowing how to use MS Word, you will not be able to become a great editor."
