-   [In Mini-Challenge 1](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2025/MC1.html), students will be provided a knowledge graph of containing recording artists, albums, collaborations, concerts, influences, and more. The goal will be to develop visual analytics approaches to trace the rise of one artist and predict who will be next to break out.
-   [In Mini-Challenge 2](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2025/MC2.html), students will take on the theme of conflict over societal change directly. Two opposing groups representing the fishing and tourism industries are vying for economic development funding and accusing a local government board of bias. Students will be asked to reconstruct a true timeline with data that comes from both sides.
-   [In Mini-Challenge 3](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2025/MC3.html), students will be provided a knowledge graph created from transcripts of boat radio communications and asked to identify people, their roles, and the events and locations they talk about to predict when and where an event will take place.
